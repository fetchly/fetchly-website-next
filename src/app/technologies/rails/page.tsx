      'Absolutely. Rails powers Shopify, GitHub, Basecamp, and thousands of production applications. It remains one of the fastest frameworks for building web applications, with a mature ecosystem and strong community.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How experienced is your team with Rails?',

      'We have shipped over 30 Rails applications across e-commerce, fintech, healthcare, and SaaS. Our engineers have 5-10 years of Rails experience and stay current with the latest releases.',

  {
    question: 'How long does a typical Rails project take?',

      'A standard CRUD application or API ships in 6-10 weeks. More complex platforms with integrations and admin tooling typically take 10-16 weeks. We scope everything upfront.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you work with our existing Rails app?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We pick up existing Rails codebases regularly — upgrading Ruby and Rails versions, refactoring legacy code, improving test coverage, and adding new features.',
