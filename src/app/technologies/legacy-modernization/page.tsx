    question: 'How long does a legacy modernization project take?',
    answer:
      'Most legacy modernization projects take 3-9 months depending on application size and complexity. We break work into incremental milestones so you see value within the first few weeks.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will there be downtime during the modernization?',
    answer:
      'No. We use a strangler fig pattern to replace legacy components one at a time while the existing system stays live. Your users never notice the transition.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you work with our existing team?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We integrate with your team, follow your processes, and transfer knowledge throughout the engagement so your developers can maintain the modernized system independently.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What modern stack should we migrate to?',
    answer:
      'It depends on your product needs, team skills, and hiring plans. We evaluate options like Node.js, Rails, Next.js, and others, then recommend the best fit with a clear rationale.',
