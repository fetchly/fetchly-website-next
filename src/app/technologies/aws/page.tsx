  {
    question: 'Can you audit our existing AWS setup?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We review your VPC layout, IAM policies, compute and storage choices, and billing to identify security gaps, performance bottlenecks, and cost savings. Most audits surface 20-40% in wasted spend.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you manage AWS infrastructure long-term?',
    answer:
      'We can. Many clients keep us on for ongoing infrastructure management, monitoring, and optimization. We also train your team to manage it independently if you prefer.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should we use ECS, EKS, or Lambda?',
    answer:
      'It depends on your workload. We recommend ECS for containerized apps that need consistent performance, Lambda for event-driven tasks, and EKS only when you need full Kubernetes compatibility.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle infrastructure as code?',
    answer:
      'We use Terraform or AWS CDK to define all infrastructure as code. Every resource is version-controlled, reviewable, and reproducible across environments.',
  },
