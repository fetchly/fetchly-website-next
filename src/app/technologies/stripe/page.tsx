    question: 'Can you integrate Stripe with our existing backend?',
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: 'Do you handle PCI compliance?',
    answer:
      'Stripe handles most PCI requirements when you use their hosted payment elements. We ensure your integration follows Stripe best practices so you stay within PCI SAQ-A scope.',

  {
    question: 'Can you build marketplace payment flows with Stripe Connect?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We build multi-party payment flows using Stripe Connect — including onboarding, split payments, platform fees, and payout schedules for your sellers or service providers.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle failed payments and dunning?',
    answer:
      'We configure Stripe Smart Retries, set up webhook listeners for payment failures, and build custom dunning email flows to recover failed subscription payments automatically.',
