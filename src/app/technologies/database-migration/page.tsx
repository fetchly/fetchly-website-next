    question: 'How long does a database migration take?',
    answer:
      'Most database migrations take 4-10 weeks depending on data volume, schema complexity, and the number of application queries that need rewriting. We scope each project before work begins.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will we lose any data during the migration?',
    answer:
      'No. We run automated data validation scripts that compare source and target databases record by record. Every migration includes checksums, rollback plans, and parallel environments.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can we migrate without downtime?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We use change data capture and dual-write patterns to keep both databases in sync during the transition, then cut over with zero downtime once validation is complete.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle schema differences between databases?',
    answer:
      'We design the target schema to match your data model and query patterns. For MongoDB to PostgreSQL migrations, we normalize document structures into relational tables optimized for your access patterns.',
