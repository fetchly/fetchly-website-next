const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    question: 'When should I choose Python and Django over Rails or Node?',
    answer:
      'Python excels when your application involves data processing, machine learning, or scientific computing. Django is a strong choice for content-heavy platforms, admin-heavy workflows, and projects where the mature Python ecosystem gives you an advantage.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How experienced is your team with Python?',

      'Our Python engineers have built production applications with Django, FastAPI, and Flask across SaaS, healthcare, fintech, and data platforms. We also have experience with data science and ML workflows.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does a typical Python project take?',
    answer:
      'A Django API or web application ships in 6-12 weeks. Data pipelines and ML-integrated systems typically take 10-16 weeks depending on the complexity of the data and model requirements.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you help with our existing Django application?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We regularly join existing Django projects — upgrading versions, improving performance, refactoring legacy code, adding test coverage, and building new features on top of established codebases.',
