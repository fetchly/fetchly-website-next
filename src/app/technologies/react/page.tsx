const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    question: 'Should I use React or Next.js?',
    answer:
      'If you need SEO, server-side rendering, or a full-stack framework, choose Next.js. If you are building a dashboard, internal tool, or single-page app behind authentication, a standalone React app is often simpler and sufficient.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How experienced is your team with React?',
    answer:
      'React is our primary frontend technology. Our engineers have built production React applications for over six years, across SaaS platforms, e-commerce, healthcare, and fintech.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does a typical React project take?',
    answer:
      'A component library or internal dashboard ships in 4-8 weeks. A full customer-facing application typically takes 8-14 weeks depending on the scope of features and integrations.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you migrate our existing frontend to React?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We have migrated applications from Angular, jQuery, and vanilla JavaScript to React. We use an incremental approach so your app stays live throughout the migration.',
  },
