    question: 'Why Contentful over a traditional CMS like WordPress?',

    question: 'Can you migrate our existing content to Contentful?',

  },
  {
    question: 'What frontend frameworks do you use with Contentful?',
    answer:
      'We typically pair Contentful with Next.js, Gatsby, or Remix. We choose the framework based on your performance needs, team skills, and deployment requirements.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does Contentful handle localization?',
    answer:
      'Contentful has built-in localization at the field level. We configure locale fallbacks, translation workflows, and multi-region delivery so your content team can manage translations efficiently.',
