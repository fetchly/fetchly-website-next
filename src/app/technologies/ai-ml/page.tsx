    question: 'Do we need a data science team to work with you?',
    answer:
      'No. We handle the full stack — from selecting the right model to deploying it in your application. Your team only needs to define the business problem and provide access to relevant data.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which AI models and providers do you work with?',
    answer:
      'We work with OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source models like Llama, and cloud ML services from AWS and Google. We choose the model based on your accuracy needs, latency requirements, and budget.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle data privacy with AI features?',
    answer:
      'We use private API endpoints, avoid sending sensitive data to third-party models when possible, and can deploy self-hosted models for regulated industries. All integrations follow your data governance policies.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does AI integration typically cost?',
    answer:
      'A prototype usually takes 2-4 weeks and fits within our standard monthly rate. Production integration varies based on complexity, but we scope it clearly before work begins so there are no surprises.',
