const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    question: 'Is React Native as good as fully native development?',
    answer:
      'For the vast majority of apps, yes. React Native shares 90-95% of code across platforms while delivering native performance. We use native modules for features that require platform-specific APIs, so you get the best of both worlds.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How experienced is your team with React Native?',
    answer:
      'We have built and shipped 15+ React Native applications to both app stores. Our mobile team has deep experience with Expo, native modules, and the React Native ecosystem.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does a typical React Native project take?',
    answer:
      'A focused mobile app ships in 8-12 weeks. Larger apps with complex integrations, offline support, and native modules typically take 12-20 weeks.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does a mobile app project cost?',
    answer:
      'Most React Native projects range from $50K to $200K depending on complexity. Because you are building one codebase instead of two, costs are typically 30-40% lower than separate native builds.',
  },
