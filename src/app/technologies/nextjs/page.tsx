const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    question: 'When should I choose Next.js over a plain React app?',
    answer:
      'Next.js is the right choice when you need SEO, fast initial page loads, or server-side logic. If your app is purely behind a login screen with no public pages, a plain React SPA may suffice — but Next.js still offers a better developer experience for most projects.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How experienced is your team with Next.js?',
    answer:
      'Our team has shipped 20+ production Next.js applications across e-commerce, SaaS, and content platforms. We use the App Router, Server Components, and the latest Next.js features in every new build.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does a typical Next.js project take?',
    answer:
      'A marketing site or content platform ships in 4-8 weeks. A full-stack SaaS application typically takes 8-16 weeks depending on scope. We give you a detailed timeline after discovery.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does a Next.js project cost?',
    answer:
      'Most projects range from $30K to $150K depending on complexity. We offer flat monthly pricing — no hourly billing or surprise invoices.',
  },
