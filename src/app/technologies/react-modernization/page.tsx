    question: 'How long does a React modernization take?',
    answer:
      'Most React modernization projects take 6-14 weeks depending on component count, Redux complexity, and whether TypeScript adoption is included. We scope each project individually before starting.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can we modernize incrementally without rewriting everything?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. Hooks and class components coexist in the same application. We migrate component by component, so your app stays live and your team stays productive throughout.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What replaces our Redux setup?',
    answer:
      'It depends on your needs. We evaluate React Context, Zustand, Jotai, or Redux Toolkit based on your application complexity, and migrate your state management to the best fit.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will our existing tests break during the migration?',
    answer:
      'We update your test suite alongside each component migration, ensuring coverage is maintained or improved at every step. Tests run in CI on every pull request.',
  },
