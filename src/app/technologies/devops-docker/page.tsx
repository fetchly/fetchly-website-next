  {
    question: 'Do we need Docker if we already use Heroku or Vercel?',
    answer:
      'Not necessarily. Docker adds value when you need environment parity, complex multi-service architectures, or plan to move to AWS or GCP. We help you decide whether containerization is worth the investment for your setup.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you set up CI/CD for our existing project?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We set up CI/CD pipelines on GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, or AWS CodePipeline. We configure automated testing, linting, security scanning, and deployment for every push.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does a DevOps setup typically take?',
    answer:
      'A basic CI/CD pipeline with Docker takes 1-2 weeks. A full infrastructure overhaul with monitoring, alerting, and infrastructure as code typically takes 4-8 weeks depending on complexity.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will our developers need to learn Docker?',
    answer:
      'We write Dockerfiles and docker-compose configs that work out of the box. Your developers run one command to start the entire stack locally. We also provide documentation and training if needed.',
  },
