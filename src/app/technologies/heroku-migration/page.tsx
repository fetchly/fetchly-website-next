    question: 'How long does a Heroku to AWS migration take?',
    answer:
      'Most Heroku to AWS migrations take 4-8 weeks depending on the number of dynos, add-ons, and database size. We scope each project individually and provide a clear timeline upfront.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will there be downtime during the migration?',
    answer:
      'No. We run your application on both Heroku and AWS simultaneously during the transition, then cut over DNS with zero downtime once everything is validated.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much will we save by leaving Heroku?',
    answer:
      'Most teams see 40-60% cost savings after migrating to AWS. We design your infrastructure for cost efficiency from day one, and provide a cost comparison before migration begins.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will our database migrate safely?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. We use proven database migration tools with full data validation, checksums, and parallel environments. Every record is verified before the cutover.',
