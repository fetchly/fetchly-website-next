    question: 'How long does an AngularJS migration take?',
    answer:
      'Most AngularJS to React migrations take 8-16 weeks depending on application size and complexity. We use an incremental approach so your application stays live throughout the process.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should we migrate to React, Vue, or modern Angular?',
    answer:
      'We help you choose based on your team skills, hiring plans, and application needs. React is our most common recommendation, but we evaluate each situation individually and present the trade-offs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can we migrate incrementally instead of rewriting?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We use tools like single-spa or module federation to run AngularJS and the new framework side by side, migrating one route or feature at a time while your application stays live.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens to our existing data and user accounts?',
    answer:
      'All data stays intact. The frontend migration does not affect your backend or database. We maintain full API compatibility throughout the transition.',
  },
