    question: 'How long does a Rails migration typically take?',
    answer:
      'Most Rails 5 to 7 migrations take 4-12 weeks depending on application size, gem dependencies, and test coverage. We scope each project individually and give you a clear timeline before work begins.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will there be downtime during the migration?',
    answer:
      'No. We run the upgraded application in a staging environment, validate every feature against your existing test suite, and deploy with zero downtime using blue-green or rolling deployments.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens to our existing gems and dependencies?',
    answer:
      'We audit every gem for Rails 7 compatibility, replace deprecated ones with maintained alternatives, and ensure your Gemfile is clean and up to date before deployment.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does a Rails migration cost?',
    answer:
      'Cost depends on scope, but our flat monthly model means no surprise invoices. We scope the engagement together and provide a predictable cost before any work begins.',
