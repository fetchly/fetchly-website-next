    question: 'How do you handle security for financial applications?',
    answer:
      'Security is built into every layer — encrypted data at rest and in transit, role-based access control, penetration testing, and SOC 2-aligned development practices. We treat security as architecture, not a checklist.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What compliance frameworks do you work with?',
    answer:
      'We build platforms that meet PCI DSS, SOC 2, TILA-RESPA, state lending regulations, and fair housing requirements. We work with your compliance team to ensure every feature meets regulatory standards before launch.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which payment processors do you integrate with?',
    answer:
      'We integrate with Stripe, Plaid, Dwolla, and custom payment rails. Whether you need ACH transfers, card processing, escrow accounts, or real-time payment splitting, we build the integration to fit your model.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you protect sensitive financial data?',
    answer:
      'We implement end-to-end encryption, tokenization for sensitive fields, audit logging for every data access event, and infrastructure hardening. Your data architecture is designed for compliance from day one.',
