  {
    question: 'How do you handle multi-tenant architecture for HR platforms?',
    answer:
      'We build true multi-tenant systems where each client gets isolated data with shared infrastructure. This means separate databases or schemas per tenant, tenant-specific configurations, and role-based access that ensures one client never sees another\'s data.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does your AI matching differ from keyword-based search?',
    answer:
      'Our AI matching analyzes the full context of a candidate\'s experience, skills, and career trajectory — not just keyword overlap. We use embeddings and semantic similarity to surface candidates who are genuinely qualified, even if their resume doesn\'t use the exact same terminology as the job description.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you integrate with existing ATS and payroll systems?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We integrate with major ATS platforms like Greenhouse, Lever, and iCIMS, as well as payroll providers like ADP, Gusto, and Paychex. We handle the API complexity and data mapping so your platform works within existing HR workflows.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle compliance across different states and jurisdictions?',
    answer:
      'We build compliance engines that track state and local employment regulations — from pay transparency laws to benefits requirements. The system updates rules per jurisdiction and flags compliance issues before they become problems.',
  },
