            <p>
              <strong>In short:</strong> We collect personal information that you provide to us.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>

            <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>In short:</strong> Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP)
              address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when
              you visit our Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the
              Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or
              contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP
              address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences,
              referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use
              our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to
              maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics
              and reporting purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar
              technologies.
            </p>

            <h3>The information we collect includes:</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Log and usage data</strong>
              <br />
              Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information
              our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we
              record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include
              your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about
              your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your
              usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which
              features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports
              (sometimes called &quot;crash dumps&quot;), and hardware settings).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Device data</strong>
              <br />
              We collect device data, such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or
              other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device
              data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and
              application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet
              service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration
              information.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Location data</strong>
              <br />
              We collect location data such as information about your device&apos;s location, which
              can be precise or approximate. How much information we collect depends on the type and
              settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and
              other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location
              (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information
              either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on
              your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain
              aspects of the Services.

              <strong>In short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe
              it is necessary, and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under

            </p>

            <h3>If you are located in the EU or UK</h3>
            <p>
              The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the

              we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
            </p>

                <strong>Performance of a contract</strong> - We may process your personal
                information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to
                you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a
                contract with you;
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Legal obligations</strong> - We may process your information where we
                believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to
                cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our
                legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are
                involved;
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Vital interests</strong> - We may process your information where we believe
                it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third
                party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>If you are located in Canada</h3>
            <p>
              We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e.,
              express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in
              situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can
              withdraw your consent at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process
              your information without your consent, including, for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be
                obtained in a timely way;
              </li>
              <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention;</li>
              <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met;</li>
              <li>
                If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess,
                process, or settle an insurance claim;
              </li>
              <li>
                For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of
                kin;
              </li>
              <li>
                If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be
                victim of financial abuse;
              </li>
              <li>
                If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the
                availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for
                purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the
                laws of Canada or a province;
              </li>
              <li>
                If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules

              </li>
              <li>
                If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or
                profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the
                information was produced;
              </li>
              <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes;</li>

              We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the
              purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required
              or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).{' '}

                No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for

            <p>
              When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
              we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for
              example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then
              we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
              processing until deletion is possible.

            <h2>7. How do we keep your information safe?</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>In short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a
              system of organizational and technical security measures.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security
              measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
              However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic
              transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to
              be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
              other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
              improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
              personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only
              access the Services within a secure environment.

              We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity
              or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting
              additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we
              cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
              request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
              identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such
