    question: 'Which AI models do you work with?',
    answer:
      'We work with OpenAI (GPT-4, embeddings), Azure AI, Anthropic Claude, open-source models like Llama and Mistral, and custom fine-tuned models. We pick the right model for your use case based on accuracy, cost, latency, and data privacy requirements.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What data do you need to get started?',
    answer:
      'It depends on the use case. For semantic search or recommendations, we need your existing content or product catalog. For document processing, we need sample documents. We start with whatever you have and build data pipelines to keep everything up to date.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle data privacy and security?',
    answer:
      'We take data privacy seriously. We support on-premise deployments, private cloud hosting, and data anonymization pipelines. For regulated industries, we work within your compliance framework and ensure no sensitive data leaves your environment.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does AI integration cost?',
    answer:
      'Our flat monthly model covers the engineering work. AI infrastructure costs (API calls, hosting) vary by usage but are typically $200-2,000/month for most products. We optimize for cost from day one and give you full visibility into spend.',
