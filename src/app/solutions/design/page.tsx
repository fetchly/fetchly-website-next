    question: 'What does your design process look like?',
    answer:
      'We start with research — understanding your users, your market, and your goals. Then we move into wireframes and prototypes, testing with real users before polishing the visual design. Nothing goes to engineering until it has been validated.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What tools do you use for design?',
    answer:
      'Figma is our primary design tool for UI/UX, components, and prototyping. We also use FigJam for workshops, Maze for usability testing, and Lottie for micro-animations. Everything is organized in shared libraries your team can access.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does design-to-dev handoff work?',
    answer:
      'Our designers and engineers work on the same team, so handoff is continuous, not a one-time event. We use Figma dev mode with annotated specs, a shared design token system, and regular sync meetings to make sure what gets built matches what was designed.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you create a design system for our existing product?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We audit your current UI, identify inconsistencies, and build a component library with tokens, patterns, and documentation. The result is a living design system that scales with your product.',
  },
