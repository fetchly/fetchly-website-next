    question: 'How long does a typical modernization project take?',
    answer:
      'It depends on the size and complexity of your system, but most projects run 3-9 months. We break the work into incremental milestones so you see value within the first few weeks, not the last.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will there be downtime during the migration?',
    answer:
      'No. Our migration plans are designed for zero downtime. We run the old and new systems in parallel and cut over module by module so your users never notice the switch.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does legacy modernization cost?',
    answer:
      'Pricing depends on scope, but our flat monthly model means no surprise invoices. We scope the engagement together and give you a predictable cost before work begins.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will we lose any existing data during migration?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely not. Data integrity is the first thing we plan for. We build automated data migration scripts, validate every record, and run parallel environments to ensure nothing is lost.',
