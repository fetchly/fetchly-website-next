faqItems:
  - question: "Can you audit our existing AWS setup?"
    answer: "Yes. We review your VPC layout, IAM policies, compute and storage choices, and billing to identify security gaps, performance bottlenecks, and cost savings. Most audits surface 20-40% in wasted spend."
  - question: "Do you manage AWS infrastructure long-term?"
    answer: "We can. Many clients keep us on for ongoing infrastructure management, monitoring, and optimization. We also train your team to manage it independently if you prefer."
  - question: "Should we use ECS, EKS, or Lambda?"
    answer: "It depends on your workload. We recommend ECS for containerized apps that need consistent performance, Lambda for event-driven tasks, and EKS only when you need full Kubernetes compatibility."
  - question: "How do you handle infrastructure as code?"
    answer: "We use Terraform or AWS CDK to define all infrastructure as code. Every resource is version-controlled, reviewable, and reproducible across environments."
