faqItems:
  - question: "Do we need a data science team to work with you?"
    answer: "No. We handle the full stack, from selecting the right model to deploying it in your application. Your team only needs to define the business problem and provide access to relevant data."
  - question: "Which AI models and providers do you work with?"
    answer: "We work with OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source models like Llama, and cloud ML services from AWS and Google. We choose the model based on your accuracy needs, latency requirements, and budget."
  - question: "How do you handle data privacy with AI features?"
    answer: "We use private API endpoints, avoid sending sensitive data to third-party models when possible, and can deploy self-hosted models for regulated industries. All integrations follow your data governance policies."
  - question: "What does AI integration typically cost?"
    answer: "A prototype usually takes 2-4 weeks and fits within our standard monthly rate. Production integration varies based on complexity, but we scope it clearly before work begins so there are no surprises."
