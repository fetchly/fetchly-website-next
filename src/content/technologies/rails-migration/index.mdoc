  - title: Audit
    description: >-
      We map your Rails version, gem dependencies, test coverage, and database
      schema to identify every upgrade blocker before writing a single line of
      code.
  - title: Plan
    description: >-
      We build a phased migration plan with version-by-version upgrades, gem
      replacements, and deprecation fixes. Each phase is deployable and testable
      independently.
  - title: Migrate
    description: >-
      We execute the upgrade incrementally, running your full test suite at
      every step, and deploy to production with zero downtime.

  - question: How long does a Rails migration typically take?
    answer: >-
      Most Rails 5 to 7 migrations take 4-12 weeks depending on application
      size, gem dependencies, and test coverage. We scope each project
      individually and give you a clear timeline before work begins.
  - question: Will there be downtime during the migration?
    answer: >-
      No. We run the upgraded application in a staging environment, validate
      every feature against your existing test suite, and deploy with zero
      downtime using blue-green or rolling deployments.
  - question: What happens to our existing gems and dependencies?
    answer: >-
      We audit every gem for Rails 7 compatibility, replace deprecated ones with
      maintained alternatives, and ensure your Gemfile is clean and up to date
      before deployment.
  - question: How much does a Rails migration cost?
    answer: >-
      Cost depends on scope, but our flat monthly model means no surprise
      invoices. We scope the engagement together and provide a predictable cost
      before any work begins.
