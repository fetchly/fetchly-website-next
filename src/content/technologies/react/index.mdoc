  - question: "Should I use React or Next.js?"
    answer: "If you need SEO, server-side rendering, or a full-stack framework, choose Next.js. If you are building a dashboard, internal tool, or single-page app behind authentication, a standalone React app is often simpler and sufficient."
  - question: "How experienced is your team with React?"
    answer: "React is our primary frontend technology. Our engineers have built production React applications for over six years, across SaaS platforms, e-commerce, healthcare, and fintech."
  - question: "How long does a typical React project take?"
    answer: A component library or internal dashboard ships in 4-8 weeks. A full customer-facing application typically takes 8-14 weeks depending on the scope of features and integrations.
  - question: "Can you migrate our existing frontend to React?"
    answer: "Yes. We have migrated applications from Angular, jQuery, and vanilla JavaScript to React. We use an incremental approach so your app stays live throughout the migration."
