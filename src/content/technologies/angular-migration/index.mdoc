faqItems:
  - question: "How long does an AngularJS migration take?"
    answer: Most AngularJS to React migrations take 8-16 weeks depending on application size and complexity. We use an incremental approach so your application stays live throughout the process.
  - question: "Should we migrate to React, Vue, or modern Angular?"
    answer: "We help you choose based on your team skills, hiring plans, and application needs. React is our most common recommendation, but we evaluate each situation individually and present the trade-offs."
  - question: "Can we migrate incrementally instead of rewriting?"
    answer: "Yes. We use tools like single-spa or module federation to run AngularJS and the new framework side by side, migrating one route or feature at a time while your application stays live."
  - question: "What happens to our existing data and user accounts?"
    answer: All data stays intact. The frontend migration does not affect your backend or database. We maintain full API compatibility throughout the transition.
