faqItems:
  - question: "Can you optimize our existing PostgreSQL database?"
    answer: "Yes. We audit your schema, analyze slow queries with EXPLAIN ANALYZE, review your indexing strategy, and implement changes that typically cut query times by 50-90% without application changes."
  - question: "Should we use PostgreSQL or another database?"
    answer: "PostgreSQL is our default recommendation for most applications. It handles relational data, JSON, full-text search, and vector embeddings. We recommend specialized databases only when your workload specifically demands it."
  - question: "How do you handle database migrations in production?"
    answer: "We use zero-downtime migration strategies: adding columns as nullable, backfilling data in batches, and swapping constraints only after data is consistent. No maintenance windows required."
  - question: "Can PostgreSQL handle AI vector search?"
    answer: "Yes. The pgvector extension adds vector similarity search directly in PostgreSQL. We set up vector columns, indexing with HNSW or IVFFlat, and integrate it with your AI pipeline. No separate vector database needed."
