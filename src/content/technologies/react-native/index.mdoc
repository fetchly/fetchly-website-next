faqItems:
  - question: "Is React Native as good as fully native development?"
    answer: "For the vast majority of apps, yes. React Native shares 90-95% of code across platforms while delivering native performance. We use native modules for features that require platform-specific APIs, so you get the best of both worlds."
  - question: "How experienced is your team with React Native?"
    answer: "We have built and shipped 15+ React Native applications to both app stores. Our mobile team has deep experience with Expo, native modules, and the React Native ecosystem."
  - question: "How long does a typical React Native project take?"
    answer: "A focused mobile app ships in 8-12 weeks. Larger apps with complex integrations, offline support, and native modules typically take 12-20 weeks."
  - question: "What does a mobile app project cost?"
    answer: "Most React Native projects range from $50K to $200K depending on complexity. Because you are building one codebase instead of two, costs are typically 30-40% lower than separate native builds."
