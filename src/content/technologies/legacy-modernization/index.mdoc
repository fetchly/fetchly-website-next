faqItems:
  - question: "How long does a legacy modernization project take?"
    answer: Most legacy modernization projects take 3-9 months depending on application size and complexity. We break work into incremental milestones so you see value within the first few weeks.
  - question: "Will there be downtime during the modernization?"
    answer: No. We use a strangler fig pattern to replace legacy components one at a time while the existing system stays live. Your users never notice the transition.
  - question: "Can you work with our existing team?"
    answer: "Yes. We integrate with your team, follow your processes, and transfer knowledge throughout the engagement so your developers can maintain the modernized system independently."
  - question: "What modern stack should we migrate to?"
    answer: "It depends on your product needs, team skills, and hiring plans. We evaluate options like Node.js, Rails, Next.js, and others, then recommend the best fit with a clear rationale."
