faqItems:
  - question: "When should I choose Python and Django over Rails or Node?"
    answer: "Python excels when your application involves data processing, machine learning, or scientific computing. Django is a strong choice for content-heavy platforms, admin-heavy workflows, and projects where the mature Python ecosystem gives you an advantage."
  - question: "How experienced is your team with Python?"
    answer: "Our Python engineers have built production applications with Django, FastAPI, and Flask across SaaS, healthcare, fintech, and data platforms. We also have experience with data science and ML workflows."
  - question: "How long does a typical Python project take?"
    answer: A Django API or web application ships in 6-12 weeks. Data pipelines and ML-integrated systems typically take 10-16 weeks depending on the complexity of the data and model requirements.
  - question: "Can you help with our existing Django application?"
    answer: "Yes. We regularly join existing Django projects, upgrading versions, improving performance, refactoring legacy code, adding test coverage, and building new features on top of established codebases."
