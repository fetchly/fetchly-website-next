  - question: "Do you only work with Shopify Plus?"
    answer: "No. We work with standard Shopify and Shopify Plus. That said, most of our clients are on Plus because they need custom checkout, scripting, and multi-store capabilities."
  - question: "Can you migrate my store from another platform to Shopify?"
    answer: "Yes. We have migrated stores from WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce, and custom platforms to Shopify. We handle product data, customer accounts, order history, and SEO redirects."
  - question: "Do you build custom Shopify apps?"
    answer: "Yes. We build public and private Shopify apps using the Shopify API and App Bridge. Common builds include custom subscription logic, loyalty programs, and ERP integrations."
  - question: "How long does a typical Shopify project take?"
    answer: A custom theme build typically takes 6-10 weeks. Headless storefronts and app development vary based on complexity but usually land in the 8-16 week range.
