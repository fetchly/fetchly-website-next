faqItems:
  - question: "How long does a database migration take?"
    answer: "Most database migrations take 4-10 weeks depending on data volume, schema complexity, and the number of application queries that need rewriting. We scope each project before work begins."
  - question: "Will we lose any data during the migration?"
    answer: "No. We run automated data validation scripts that compare source and target databases record by record. Every migration includes checksums, rollback plans, and parallel environments."
  - question: "Can we migrate without downtime?"
    answer: "Yes. We use change data capture and dual-write patterns to keep both databases in sync during the transition, then cut over with zero downtime once validation is complete."
  - question: "How do you handle schema differences between databases?"
    answer: "We design the target schema to match your data model and query patterns. For MongoDB to PostgreSQL migrations, we normalize document structures into relational tables optimized for your access patterns."
