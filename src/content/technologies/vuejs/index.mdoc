  - question: "When should I choose Vue.js over React?"
    answer: "Vue is an excellent choice when your team values a gentler learning curve, strong conventions, and an integrated ecosystem. It is particularly popular for enterprise dashboards, progressive web apps, and teams transitioning from jQuery or server-rendered templates."
  - question: "How experienced is your team with Vue.js?"
    answer: "Our frontend engineers have built production Vue applications with both the Options API and Composition API. We have shipped Vue 3 and Nuxt 3 projects across SaaS, e-commerce, and enterprise platforms."
  - question: "How long does a typical Vue.js project take?"
    answer: "A Vue SPA or Nuxt application typically ships in 6-12 weeks. Larger platforms with complex state management, SSR, and integrations take 10-16 weeks depending on scope."
  - question: "Can you migrate our Vue 2 app to Vue 3?"
    answer: "Yes. We have handled multiple Vue 2 to Vue 3 migrations, including converting from the Options API to the Composition API, migrating from Vuex to Pinia, and upgrading from Nuxt 2 to Nuxt 3."
