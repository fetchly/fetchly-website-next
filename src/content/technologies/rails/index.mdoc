  - question: "Is Ruby on Rails still a good choice in 2025?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Rails powers Shopify, GitHub, Basecamp, and thousands of production applications. It remains one of the fastest frameworks for building web applications, with a mature ecosystem and strong community."
  - question: "How experienced is your team with Rails?"
    answer: "We have shipped over 30 Rails applications across e-commerce, fintech, healthcare, and SaaS. Our engineers have 5-10 years of Rails experience and stay current with the latest releases."
  - question: "How long does a typical Rails project take?"
    answer: A standard CRUD application or API ships in 6-10 weeks. More complex platforms with integrations and admin tooling typically take 10-16 weeks. We scope everything upfront.
  - question: "Can you work with our existing Rails app?"
    answer: "Yes. We pick up existing Rails codebases regularly, upgrading Ruby and Rails versions, refactoring legacy code, improving test coverage, and adding new features."
