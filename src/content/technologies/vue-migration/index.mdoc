faqItems:
  - question: "How long does a Vue 2 to Vue 3 migration take?"
    answer: "Most Vue 2 to Vue 3 migrations take 4-10 weeks depending on component count, Vuex usage, and third-party plugin dependencies. We scope every project individually before work begins."
  - question: "Will our application have downtime during migration?"
    answer: "No. We migrate components incrementally using the Vue 3 compatibility build as a bridge, then cut over to full Vue 3 when everything is validated and tested."
  - question: "What happens to our Vuex stores?"
    answer: "We migrate Vuex stores to Pinia, the officially recommended state management solution for Vue 3. Pinia offers better TypeScript support, simpler API, and improved devtools integration."
  - question: "How much does a Vue migration cost?"
    answer: Pricing depends on application size and complexity. Our flat monthly model means predictable costs with no surprise invoices. We scope the engagement and agree on cost before any work begins.
