faqItems:
  - question: "How long does a React modernization take?"
    answer: "Most React modernization projects take 6-14 weeks depending on component count, Redux complexity, and whether TypeScript adoption is included. We scope each project individually before starting."
  - question: "Can we modernize incrementally without rewriting everything?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Hooks and class components coexist in the same application. We migrate component by component, so your app stays live and your team stays productive throughout."
  - question: "What replaces our Redux setup?"
    answer: "It depends on your needs. We evaluate React Context, Zustand, Jotai, or Redux Toolkit based on your application complexity, and migrate your state management to the best fit."
  - question: "Will our existing tests break during the migration?"
    answer: "We update your test suite alongside each component migration, ensuring coverage is maintained or improved at every step. Tests run in CI on every pull request."
