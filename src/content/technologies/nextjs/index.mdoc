faqItems:
  - question: "When should I choose Next.js over a plain React app?"
    answer: "Next.js is the right choice when you need SEO, fast initial page loads, or server-side logic. If your app is purely behind a login screen with no public pages, a plain React SPA may suffice, but Next.js still offers a better developer experience for most projects."
  - question: "How experienced is your team with Next.js?"
    answer: "Our team has shipped 20+ production Next.js applications across e-commerce, SaaS, and content platforms. We use the App Router, Server Components, and the latest Next.js features in every new build."
  - question: "How long does a typical Next.js project take?"
    answer: A marketing site or content platform ships in 4-8 weeks. A full-stack SaaS application typically takes 8-16 weeks depending on scope. We give you a detailed timeline after discovery.
  - question: "What does a Next.js project cost?"
    answer: "Most projects range from $30K to $150K depending on complexity. We offer flat monthly pricing. No hourly billing or surprise invoices."
