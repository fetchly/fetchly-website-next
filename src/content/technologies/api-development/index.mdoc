faqItems:
  - question: "Should we use REST or GraphQL?"
    answer: REST is simpler and works well for most CRUD applications. GraphQL shines when you have multiple clients with different data needs or deeply nested relationships. We help you choose based on your use case.
  - question: "Do you write API documentation?"
    answer: "Yes. Every API we build ships with OpenAPI (Swagger) specs for REST or schema documentation for GraphQL. We also generate interactive docs so your frontend team and partners can explore endpoints easily."
  - question: "How do you handle API versioning?"
    answer: "We design APIs with versioning from the start: typically URL-based versioning for REST and schema evolution for GraphQL. This lets you ship breaking changes without disrupting existing consumers."
  - question: "Can you integrate with third-party APIs?"
    answer: "Yes. We integrate with payment providers, CRMs, ERPs, shipping APIs, and any service with a documented API. We build resilient integrations with retry logic, circuit breakers, and proper error handling."
