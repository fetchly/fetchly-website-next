  - question: "What frontend frameworks do you use with Contentful?"
    answer: "We typically pair Contentful with Next.js, Gatsby, or Remix. We choose the framework based on your performance needs, team skills, and deployment requirements."

    answer: "Contentful has built-in localization at the field level. We configure locale fallbacks, translation workflows, and multi-region delivery so your content team can manage translations efficiently."
