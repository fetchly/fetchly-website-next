  - question: "How long does a Heroku to AWS migration take?"
    answer: "Most Heroku to AWS migrations take 4-8 weeks depending on the number of dynos, add-ons, and database size. We scope each project individually and provide a clear timeline upfront."
  - question: "Will there be downtime during the migration?"
    answer: "No. We run your application on both Heroku and AWS simultaneously during the transition, then cut over DNS with zero downtime once everything is validated."
  - question: "How much will we save by leaving Heroku?"
    answer: "Most teams see 40-60% cost savings after migrating to AWS. We design your infrastructure for cost efficiency from day one, and provide a cost comparison before migration begins."
  - question: "Will our database migrate safely?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We use proven database migration tools with full data validation, checksums, and parallel environments. Every record is verified before the cutover."
