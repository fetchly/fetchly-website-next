faqItems:
  - question: "What kind of test coverage can we expect?"
    answer: "We aim for meaningful coverage, not vanity metrics. That means critical user flows are covered first, then we expand to edge cases. Most projects reach 80%+ code coverage within the first engagement period."
  - question: "What testing frameworks do you use?"
    answer: "We work with the frameworks that fit your stack: Cypress and Playwright for end-to-end, Jest and Vitest for unit testing, k6 and Artillery for performance, and OWASP ZAP for security scanning. We adapt to your tooling, not the other way around."
  - question: "How much does QA testing cost?"
    answer: "Our flat monthly model means a predictable cost for a dedicated QA team. No hourly billing, no surprise invoices. We scope the engagement together before work begins."
  - question: "Can you integrate testing into our existing CI/CD pipeline?"
    answer: "Absolutely. We plug automated test suites directly into your CI/CD pipeline so every pull request runs the full suite. Failed tests block merges, and you get a dashboard with pass/fail reports on every build."
