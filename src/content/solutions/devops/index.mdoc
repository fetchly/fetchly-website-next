  - question: "Which cloud providers do you work with?"
    answer: "We work primarily with AWS, but we also support GCP and Azure. If you are already on a provider, we optimize what you have. If you are starting fresh, we help you pick the right platform for your workload and budget."
  - question: "Can you migrate our infrastructure without downtime?"
    answer: "Yes. We plan migrations with blue-green deployments, database replication, and incremental traffic shifting so your users experience zero interruption during the cutover."
  - question: "How much can you reduce our cloud costs?"
    answer: "Most teams we audit are overspending by 30-50% due to oversized instances, idle resources, and missing reserved capacity. We right-size your infrastructure and set up cost alerts so you know exactly where every dollar goes."
  - question: "Do you provide ongoing DevOps support or just setup?"
    answer: "Both. We can do a one-time infrastructure setup and hand off to your team with documentation, or we can provide ongoing managed DevOps as part of your monthly engagement. Most clients start with setup and keep us for ongoing optimization."
