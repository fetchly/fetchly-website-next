faqItems:
  - question: "How long does a typical modernization project take?"
    answer: "It depends on the size and complexity of your system, but most projects run 3-9 months. We break the work into incremental milestones so you see value within the first few weeks, not the last."
  - question: "Will there be downtime during the migration?"
    answer: No. Our migration plans are designed for zero downtime. We run the old and new systems in parallel and cut over module by module so your users never notice the switch.
  - question: "How much does legacy modernization cost?"
    answer: "Pricing depends on scope, but our flat monthly model means no surprise invoices. We scope the engagement together and give you a predictable cost before work begins."
  - question: "Will we lose any existing data during migration?"
    answer: "Absolutely not. Data integrity is the first thing we plan for. We build automated data migration scripts, validate every record, and run parallel environments to ensure nothing is lost."
