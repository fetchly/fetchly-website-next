  - question: "Can you work with our existing codebase?"
    answer: "Yes. We start with a thorough audit and give you an honest assessment of what's salvageable and what needs rebuilding."
  - question: "How do you handle agency transitions?"
    answer: "We've done this dozens of times. We review all existing code, documentation, and infrastructure, then create a transition plan."
  - question: "What if the code is unsalvageable?"
    answer: "We'll tell you honestly. Sometimes a targeted rebuild is faster and cheaper than fixing a broken foundation."
  - question: "How quickly can you stabilize a failing project?"
    answer: Most rescue projects see critical bugs resolved within the first two weeks. Full stabilization depends on scope.
