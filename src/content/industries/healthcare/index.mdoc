faqItems:
  - question: "How do you ensure HIPAA compliance in your builds?"
    answer: "HIPAA compliance is architected into every layer: encrypted data at rest and in transit, role-based access controls, audit logging, and BAA agreements with all infrastructure providers. We conduct security reviews at every milestone, not just at launch."
  - question: "Can you build software for FDA-regulated medical devices?"
    answer: "Yes. We follow IEC 62304 software lifecycle processes and build with the documentation and traceability required for FDA 510(k) and De Novo submissions. Our development process includes risk analysis, design controls, and validation testing."
  - question: "Do you integrate with existing EHR/EMR systems?"
    answer: "We integrate with Epic, Cerner, Athenahealth, and other major EHR systems using HL7 FHIR, SMART on FHIR, and custom APIs. We handle the complexity of healthcare data standards so your platform works within existing clinical workflows."
  - question: "How do you handle PHI and patient data security?"
    answer: "All protected health information is encrypted, access-controlled, and audit-logged. We use HIPAA-compliant infrastructure (AWS GovCloud or Azure Healthcare), implement minimum necessary access policies, and conduct regular penetration testing."
